## Current Status
**Major Breakthrough**: Successfully resolved TypeScript compilation errors by replacing incomplete ai-agent-training.ts with the complete implementation from ai-training-complete-final.ts. The training system now has all 4 scenarios:

1. **Basic Development Workflow** (5 tasks)
2. **Complex Problem Solving** (5 tasks)  
3. **Learning and Adaptation** (5 tasks)
4. **Jarvis AI Collaborative Learning** (3 tasks)

**Total: 18 comprehensive training tasks across multi-agent coordination, development workflows, learning mechanisms, and collaborative intelligence.**

## Next Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Test training system compilation and execution
2. 🔄 Execute Basic Development Workflow training scenario
3. 📊 Monitor agent performance metrics
4. 🧠 Track emergent behaviors and learning patterns
